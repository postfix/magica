# Tests Data

We use these files for regressions testing.

These files were not (and should not) be used for training purposes.

They are organized by directory:
- `basic/`: a number of simple files of various content types.
- `mitra/`: a selection of the files available at [https://github.com/corkami/mitra](https://github.com/corkami/mitra/tree/master/input).
